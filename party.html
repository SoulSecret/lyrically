<p>[Verse 1]<br>
I hopped off the plane at LAX<br>
With a dream and my cardigan<br>
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)<br>
Am I gonna fit in?<br>
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time<br>
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign<br>
This is all so crazy<br>
Everybody seems so famous<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick<br>
Too much pressure and I'm nervous<br>
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio<br>
And a JAY-Z song was on<br>
And a JAY-Z song was on<br>
And a JAY-Z song was on<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"<br>
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"<br>
Got my hands up, they're playing my song<br>
I know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. <br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. <br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Get to the club in my taxi cab<br>
Everybody's lookin' at me now<br>
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?<br>
She gotta be from out of town"<br>
So hard with my girls not around me<br>
It's definitely not a Nashville party<br>
'Cause all I see are stilettos<br>
I guess I never got the memo<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick<br>
Too much pressure and I'm nervous<br>
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"<br>
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"<br>
Got my hands up, they're playing my song<br>
I know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. <br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. <br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)<br>
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)<br>
Something stops me every time (Every time)<br>
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright (Hey, hey)<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" (N-n-n-noddin' my head)<br>
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" (Ooh, yeah)<br>
Got my hands up, they're playing my song<br>
I know I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)<br>
Yeah (Na-na, na-na), it's a party in the U.S.A. <br>
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. <br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away (Flying away)<br>
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" (Noddin' my head like, "Yeah")<br>
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" (Movin' my hips like, "Yeah")<br>
Got my hands up, they're playing my song<br>
I know I'm gonna be okay (I'm gonna be okay)<br>
Yeah (Yeah), it's a party in the U.S.A. <br>
Yeah (Ha-ha-ha-ha), it's a party in the U.S.A.
