<p>[Intro]<br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Brown guilty eyes and<br>
Little white lies, yeah<br>
I played dumb, but I always knew<br>
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse<br>
I kept quiet so I could keep you<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
And ain't it funny how you ran to her<br>
The second that we called it quits?<br>
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?<br>
Now it sure as hell don't look like it<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You betrayed me<br>
And I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
You talked to her when we were together<br>
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter<br>
It took you two weeks to go off and date her<br>
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Now you bring her around just to shut me down<br>
Show her off like she's a new trophy<br>
And I know if you were true<br>
There's no damn way that you<br>
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
And ain't it funny? All the twisted games<br>
All the questions you used to avoid<br>
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up<br>
And you told me I was paranoid?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You betrayed me<br>
And I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
You talked to her when we were together<br>
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter<br>
It took you two weeks to go off and date her<br>
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
(Ah-ah-ah)<br>
God, I wish that you had thought this through<br>
Before I went and fell in love with you<br>
(Ah-ah-ah)<br>
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made<br>
Don't you dare forget about the way<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You betrayed me<br>
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
You talked to her when we were together<br>
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter<br>
It took you two weeks to go off and date her<br>
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor<br>
(Ah-ah-ah)<br>
Yeah, you're still a traitor<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
God, I wish that you had thought this through<br>
Before I went and fell in love with you
