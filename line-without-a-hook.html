<p>[Verse 1]<br>
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me when we're alone<br>
You can hold my hand if no one's home<br>
Do you like it when I'm away?<br>
If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?<br>
I can feel all my bones coming back,Â and I'm craving motion<br>
Mama never really learned how to live by herself<br>
It's a curse, and it's growing<br>
You're a pond, and I'm an ocean, oh<br>
All my emotions feel like explosions when you are around<br>
And I've found a way to kill the sound, oh<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
I need you here to stay<br>
I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
Crying at the lake<br>
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?<br>
Oh, and if I could take it all back<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
I said no, (I said no) I said no (I said no)<br>
Listen close, it's a no<br>
The wind is a-pounding on my back<br>
And I've found hope in a heart attack<br>
Oh, at last, it is past<br>
Now I've got it, and you can't have it<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
I need you here to stay<br>
I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
Crying at the lake<br>
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?<br>
Oh, and if I could take it all back<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Darling, when I'm fast asleep<br>
I've seen this person watching me<br>
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"<br>
Oh-oh<br>
<br>
[Post-Bridge]<br>
'Cause there is something, and there is nothing<br>
There is nothing in between<br>
And in my eyes there is a tiny dancer watching over me<br>
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"<br>
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a-"<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
I need you here to stay<br>
Broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
Crying at the lake<br>
Oh, was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?<br>
Oh, and if I could take it all back<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
